# I started this week accessing our discord and ran into issues with getting that up and running
# I came upon this error message when trying to get onto our discord "Java Script Error" (See first image in Word Doc)
# I was able to just go back and sign back in and it worked.
# Once I was on the page I was not able to see any feeds but realized I had to react to the post I was seeing and the Voila, "A Whole New World"
# Moved on to downloading Conda. This is starting to get out of my comfort zone but I am powering through. Went through downloading. Was unsure which one to download at first as it was different than the pictures shown in week 2 but I figured it out by looking at the Bit of the one suggested.
# I got to downloading and the message came up pictured in the 5th screenshot, not sure if this is something I will need to do in the future but definitely interesting
# The nerves keep coming up everytime I click something new but its exciting when it finally does work which has been the case so far! (words of death I know)
# Did the next step, Conda –version
# And python is installed.
# So I got as far as the directory and then got an error message because I misunderstood. I literally put in cd subfolder but reread instructions and realized I meant I needed to type in the name of the subfolder. Oops.
# Okay tried a couple things, gives me an error message each time, I will try and figure this out by comparing mine to the example
# We will restart the excersize
# $ pwd    YES
# $ ls     YES
# $ cd Michael  Got my name back which got me back into the folder
# Figured out how to remove my name and get it back again don’t know what the means and am still not able to expand any subfolders but got the list. I may just not have any subfolders in those things. I will try 1 more time then look around
# Got users and Michael back in my command line. YES
# figured it out!!!!!!! Did a little happy dance. I just realized that you aren’t neccesarily going to see what is in each file but can navigate the folders within the files. Now it only worked for my desktop so I will eventually figure out how to navigate more but still I am proud of myself
# Onto Downloading wget
# Okay clicked to my C: folder tried to save and now I have an error message:
# I don’t have permission to save to this location?
# Googled it, am gonna do some research
# I ensured I am the admin for my computer and am now going into the properties of the file to see if that can help. I have saved it into the downloads folder for now.
# Okay! I got it into c:/ windows by changing the properties to run the program as admin all the time with help from a blog post that I also saved to my Zotero. Heck yeah! Feeling kinda boss right now. I am going to double check it is where it needs to be and move on
# Thank you PC Risk (Blog post by them, no official author)
# I also did my first annotation using Hypothesis
# Okay, was successful with everything in the next activity until I got to pulling the URLs. It gave me this error message. I shall research
# Looked through our discord and found that Nadia had the same error message on a windows so I will try the solution you had her use instead of typing just wget to type wget.exe
# Still aving some issues
#Trying with regular command prompt
# Still did not work. Looked into what I was using, and discovered I was in regular powershell not Anaconda powershell, searched anaconda powershell on my PC and opened, will try from the start again
# Going to shut down and walk away for a little bit then try again later. Thursday 3:22pm
# Okay, reopened Anaconda powershell prompt and went through from the beginning of this weeks work. Was able to get up to the same place as before. I will try troubleshooting on the proper powershell and go back to discord to see if there is anything else. If not I will google.
# It is not an issue with wget. It has a problem with the 2 in the command because when I change the wget to wget.exe it doesn’t recognize it but has no problem recognizing it when it is just wget

#Okay so I got super frustrated and started working on the issues with people in discord and forgot to record it in here basically we backtracked, got lost and are trying to figure out where to start
# We figured out, used Command Prompt rather than Powershell
# Got it working! Praise the computer gods
# I did it! Got all of the files downloaded onto my PC
# Moving on to the second activity it doesn’t seem to like it. I created my new file in Sublime and copied the Urls, used the command via our Git and it gives me this error code
# I tried changing the file name as well as deleting and remaking it. I will come back tomorrow with fresh eyes and try again!
# Okay so. I fiddled around, could not figure it out. I got multiple error messages. 
# 1st I was using wget rather than wget.exe in my command
#2nd I had named my file urls.txt.txt somehow. I figured this out by pulling my list and seeing the file name I was commanding was not the same as the file I wanted it to read. I also got rid of the rate because it was giving me the same issue as last night and that is a solution Dr. Graham used as part of it
# From There everything went smoothly, followed the instructions as per week 2
# Got to R Studio and had to download directly trough links Dr.G provided as it would not download through Powershell. 
# was successful with activity 1 in Rstudio
# Had issues with Activity 2 as myfiles were not recognizing data in the folder
# I realized I had my working Directory in the specific pictures folder rather than the broader folder that folder was in. Changed working directories and it worked! 
# Went on to Bonus activity and went fine upto using git. It is saying that git and git.exe are not recognized as a cmdlet so I am going to put this bonus activity away for another day as the first activities took me quite a bit of time to figure out. 
# all in all this week pushed me but was good
